		<summary>A lot of people on the Fediverse use abbreviations when entering content warnings. Whether or not that's a good thing to do or not is besides the point. The fact is, it's a thing that happens, and there are quite a few abbreviations, which can make it pretty difficult for somebody that's new to fedi.<br />
<br />
Below is a list of content warnings that are relatively often seen on fedi. There are also some more obscure ones, as this is meant to be a fairly comprahensive list. If there are any missing that you know of, please do feel free to contribute! </summary>
